# ScaleRNA AllCells as Input to Workflow
The workflow requires passing cell barcode designations for each sample analyzed. This information is leveraged from the ScaleRNA workflow, found in the SAMPLE.allCells.csv document generated and found in the "samples" folder in the ScaleRNA workflow output directory. Specifically the "pass" column. These files should match the samples being sequenced in the CRISPR library. An easy way to provide the necessary input for the workflow, set the allCells parameter to be the path to the `samples` directory within the ScaleRNA output for the same data and the pipeline will find the files specified in the samples.csv
